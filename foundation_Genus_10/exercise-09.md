## Exercise 9 - Documents
Your next task will be to add the possibility of dragging documents into a tab in the Company-form.

For this, you will have to model an object «Document» (like «Mail») that allows the user to save the file in the database. You will also have to build the functionality for handling "drag-and-drop" to and from Genus CRM.

####1. Model Object Class «Document».

To save some time, use the SQL query below to create a Document-table in the database.
   
SQL: 

```
CREATE TABLE Document (
 DocumentID uniqueidentifier PRIMARY KEY,
 FileName varchar(240), 
 FileData varbinary(max), 
 FileSize int, 
 FileExtension varchar(30), 
 CreatedDate datetime, 
 CreatedByUserID uniqueidentifier, 
 ModifiedDate datetime, 
 ModifiedByUserID uniqueidentifier, 
 CompanyID uniqueidentifier,
 ContactID uniqueidentifier
 )
```

Right-click within the Object Class Diagram (or in the Object Class section of the Navigation Pane), and select New -> Object Domain. Choose database table Document, make DocumentID the primary key (generate identifier automatically), and define each property's correct Data Interpretation. Make sure that the Data Interpretations of File Name, File Data, File Extension and File Size are set to the built-in data types with identical names. Also remember that Modified By and Created By should both be interpreted as Users.

####2. Create an action "Paste new Document from File". 

This should take Company and File(s) as input, and create Document(s).

*Guidance: You will need 3 data sources; Company (name="Company (input)", Max Occurrences="one", private=no), General File (name="General files (input), Max Occurrences="unbound", private=no) and Document (name="Documents (to be created)", Max Occurrences=unbound, private=yes). The action is logically very simple. All you need is a Scope and a Create Objects effect. If you need inspiration, you can look at the equivalent action «Paste new Mail from file». Remember to define the security of the action after creation.*

*Tip: The file-input comes with Max Occurrances "unbounded". For each file, a document has to be made. Here you can either make use of an Enumerator which loops through the General File data source OR (even simpler) you can define a Create Object on data source Document which is bound to the General File data source at the top level. The latter option will create a document per instance in the "General Files (input)" data source!*

####3. Create document-tab in the Company-form

Expand the tab sheet in the Company-form with a new tab for listing documents. Add a Grid, and define which columns to show and what sorting to use. Place a Command pointing to the action that you just made on the Documents-tab, along with an Event to trigger it on the grid itself. Add also commands and events for Delete and Invoke a File (open document by double-clicking).

Insert a "file viewer" on the right side of the grid for showing files (take a look at tab "Mail" for inspiration).

*Tip: For the event to trigger when files are pasted into the grid, choose Menu Item = Past Special. Note that you can - under the command's data filter parameter - filter out General File types Mail Message and Calendar Item from the input to the action, as you don't want to store these file types as Documents (but rather as Mail or Activity):*

####4. OPTIONAL: Create an action "Copy Document to Clipboard as File"

This action will be the equivalent to "Copy Mail to Clipboard as Mail Message". Publish it.

*Guidance: The action should take Documents as input and should create General Files. Make it available through an Event with Menu item = Copy.*

####5. OPTIONAL: Add Delete and Paste/Copy to the Ribbon.

*Guidance: Create two new Tab Sections under Context Tab Group "Document" and Tab "Document Management": Tab Section "Manage" for Delete and Tab Section "Clipboard" for Paste/Copy to Clipboard. Recall symbols and enabling conditions.*
   
The next thing for you to make is the functionality for sending e-mail to contact persons and store them as «Mail». This exercise is again optional, but we recommend you to at least browse through it and look at the solution.

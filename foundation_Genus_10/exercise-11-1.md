## Exercise 11 - Business Intelligence
**SESSION BY INSTRUCTOR:** *The instructor will start off by giving you a brief introduction to the topic. The session will concern Genus App's report functionality.* 

In Genus Apps, we have a product called "Genus Discovery". This is a report and analysis tool. The report part is mainly used for setting up predefined reports that benefits the end user.

The tool can also be made available from the client, so that dedicated groups of end users can set up or modify reports/analysis themselves.

You will now go through a couple of exercises concerning the creation of reports. **A brief summary of the report functionality of Genus Discovery is described here:**

A new report is created from Genus Studio -> Discovery -> Reports -> New. The tool's structure is logically set up as shown below:

![oppg10fig1.JPG](media/oppg10fig1.JPG)
 
To make an Object Class available as a dimension in a report, you must specifically assign this feature to the Object Class (right-click on the Object Class -> Open -> Data Aggregation). Likewise, you will have to check the "Enable as Measure" option (right-click on the Object Class Property -> Open -> Data Aggregation) if you want to use an Object Class Property as a Measure for calculating sums, counts, etc (ref Activity's No Of Activities property). **Note that this is done already.**

In addition, you will have to specify how to group No of Activities per month, as this can be based either on «Created date» or «Completed date». You will have to determine which links to use ("Connections") in the report.

Connections that will become available in the report, and hence possible to choose from, are defined under Object Classes in Studio:

*Note: You don't have to specify the link between Activity and Company, as Activity has a Company-field directly. However, if No of Activities is to be grouped by for example Country, you will have to add a Connection from Activity to Country through Company in the list shown above. Note also that when you are working in Genus Discovery (reports), you are working in the client. Accordingly, if you for example add a new connection to an Object Class, you will have to deploy in order to make the Connection available for reports.*

In the report, you can set up connections from No of Activities to the "Month" and "Company" dimensions by right-clicking No of Activities -> Connections:

You can also define "Local Filters" on objects in the Report, if you somehow want to restrict the data (e.g. you want a report with numbers based on Activities having State="Completed" only).

####1. Create a report "Activities per Company Speciality YTD".
The report should count the number of completed Activities per Month per Company Speciality so far this year. It should also sum the number of activities both horizontally and vertically, and be presented to the end user either as a table or as a line chart.

*Tip: You will have to set up a new Connection from Activity to Company Speciality (through Company). You also need to make object class Company Speciality available as a dimension in reports (i.e. check the "Enable as dimension in reports" option found in the object's Data Aggregation properties tab).*

*In order to sum data, right-click on "No of Activities" in the report -> Series Calculation and choose to sum over both Month and Company Speciality. Check "Calculate intersections" in both sum functions to get the "sum of sums" (i.e. sum of activities for all Company Specialities for all months YTD) in the bottom right corner:*

*You can control which buttons to show in the report by checking/unchecking them in the "Buttons" menu (upper right). Allow the user to shift period back and forth. In addition, check Explore, Table, Line (line chart) and Filter Pane. By adding both Table and Line, the user can choose to see the trend as a line per Company Speciality or as a table per month per Company Speciality.*

We haven't said anything about the setup of "No of Activities" as an Object Class Property yet. If you open Object Class Property "No of Activities" from Studio, you will see that the field is of type "function". In other words, the field is not refering to a specific column in the database (Provider Name), but is instead calculated. The value is set according to the RDBMS expression ("\*") defined in the Data Calculation tab and the aggregation method ("count") selected under Data Aggregation. When "No of Activities" is used as a measure in a report, a SQL statement "select count(\*) from.." grouped on the report's dimensions is executed.

####2. Create a report "Sales per Company last 3 months".
The report should have measure "Order Value NOK" and dimensions "Month" (select last month and two months back) and "Company". Only Requests of Type="Order" and State="Closed" should be shown, and the connection against Month should based on Received Date.

*Tip: You need to make sure that object class Request is available as a dimension (Data Aggregation), and that Request.Order Value NOK is available as a measure with Method="Sum". In addition, you will have to make a Connection from Request to Month. There is a shortcut for doing the latter in Genus: Right-click on Received Date -> Create Calendar Connection.* 

####3. Create a report "Company Benchmark"
The report should contain measures "Annual Sales" and "Employees" from Company, and utilize Company as vertical dimension to show a Plot diagram.

*Comment: Take a look at the provided solution if needed. This report can be used to distinguish between companies with potential and companies to keep away from. As the diagram shows all Annual Sales plotted against Number of Employees for all companies, a point "above the curve" is a company doing well (i.e. generates a lot of revenue per employee).*

####4. OPTIONAL: Create a report "Monthly Sales and Activities per Employee"
The report should show No of Activities, Sales (from Request.Order Value NOK) and Avg Sales per Request (formula based on Order Value NOK / NO of Requests) for the current month.

Add also a Measure (formula) "Sales Increase" that shows the increase or decrease of sales relative to last month.

*Tip: You need to make a new Object Class Property on Request: No of Requests (equivalent to No of Activities). To be able to calculate Avg Sales per Request, you must use a Formula in the report tool. In a Formula, you can set up an expression based on the published Measures of the report (under "Values"). Accordingly, you will have to add No of Request to the report as measure and make it Hidden.* 

*To make a formula for Sales Increase, you will need a Measure that shows Sales last month: Copy "Sales" (right-click -> copy), rename it to "Sales (last month)", navigate to the "Period Shift" setting and add "-1" (minus one). Then, make a Formula "Sales - Sales (last month)".*

*Make sure that the Sales measure only includes Requests in state "Closed" and of type "Order". You can do this "per measure" (right-click -> Local Filters) OR you can add Request State and Request Type to the "Filters" section of the report and define filters here. Measures that are connected to any (or all) of the latter filter objects will be filtered accordingly. If you don't want to define Connections every time you are using the sales measure, you can - in the Data Aggregation tab of Object Class Request - set up default connections. These are connections that will be set automatically in reports.*

####5. OPTIONAL: Add report shortcuts to the Navigation Pane.

All reports (given that you have the rights to see them) are available from the Discovery menu in the client. In some cases, however, it can be useful to create shortcuts to reports in the Navigation Pane (e.g. reports are of high importance or are frequently used). Take a look at the provided solution if you want to see how reports have been published there.

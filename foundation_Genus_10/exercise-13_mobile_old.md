## Exercise 13 - Genus Web Apps
**SESSION BY INSTRUCTOR:** *The instructor will start off by giving you a brief introduction to Genus App-form modeling.*

### Simple web interface
In this exercise, you will make a simple web interface that shows current activities associated with companies for which the logged in user is responsible. It should also be possible to change the status to Completed.

####1. Preparation for Genus Apps:

1. Deploy to all (you need to deploy to all for things to show in the web browser. It takes about 10 seconds from deployment until changes are reflected on the web).
2. Verify that you reach the following web site: *<URL to your assigned solution>/web* 
   As of now, you should only see a header and an option to log out and close.
	
####2. Create a new Web Form:
	
1. Add a new Form: "My Activities" (Web/Mobile -> right-click Forms -> New)
   * Navigate to View
   * Name: "My Activities - Main".
   * Check Platform options: Tablet, Web on Phone, Web on Tablet, Web on Desktop.
   * Padding: 24
   
####3. Add a headline

1. Drag in a Text-control from App Controls:
	
![oppg11fig1.JPG](media/oppg11fig1.JPG)
   
   * Label: ""
   * Content: "My Activities"
   * Foreground Color: Navy
   * Font Size 24
   
####4. Add a repeating section

The repeating section should iterate over Activities ("Not Started" or "In Progress") belonging to Companies which the logged in user is responsible for. Display company name, activity subject and activity status. 

1. Add data source Activity

![oppg11fig2.JPG](media/oppg11fig2.JPG)

2. Create a Repeating Section that iterates over Activity
   * Drag a GroupBox into the View. 
   * Set Vertical Alignment: Top
   * Bind the GroupBox to the Activity data source.
   * Check "Repeat Content".
   * Sort the GroupBox on Due Time (Descending).
3. Add text fields for company name, activity subject, deadline and activity state:
   * Drag or double-click 4 Text-controls into the GroupBox.
   * Bind the first to Datasource:Activity - Field:Company.Name, and do the equivalent for Activity.Subject, Due(Fx) and Activity.State.Display Name.
        
     *Note: Although Activity is an unbounded data source and the field is only supposed to show one single text string, you don't have to specify Active Object in DataSource. This is because you are already in the context of an active Activity-object when you are within a repeating Activity section.*
     
####5. Build an App bound to form My Activities.

* Navigate to Apps under User Interface in Genus Studio.
* Create a new one which you call "My Activities". Form "My Activities".
* Check default view for all relevant platforms.
* Set AppBar Foreground to Navy
* After saving, define the security of the App. (Properties -> Super Users should be able to "Find and List" and "Read and Execute").
   
####6. Deploy to all

Verify that you get expected results in the browser. You should see something like this:

####7. Add button to change state to Completed

In the repeating section, add a button for changing the state of the activity to Complete.

* Add a new action with input Activity (Name: T.Activity, Max Occurences: One, Private=false).
* Under General: set “Enable Run on Application Server”=true
* Under Actions: Add a Scope with a Modify Object that changes State to Completed.
* Save and add security:

![oppg11fig4.JPG](media/oppg11fig4.JPG)

* Drag a Button from App Controls into the repeating section (Activities).
  * Set background color = white, foreground color = navy and border color = navy, show border=true.
  * Label: "Complete"
* To run the action, create a command+event and place them both on the button. Remember to define the Data Filter (Two-Way Binding to Activity.Single Selected).
* Deploy and verify that the button works as expected.
* Move things around and adjust until you are happy with the display.

### Open Data, Local Objects and Map
In this exercise, we will fetch open data from public API’s, store it in local objects and visualize the aggregate data in a map. Note that we do not store any of the data in the database, everything is stored in memory as the client uses the app.

####1. Create a new web-form

* Mark the view and name it “Main - map”
* Check all Platforms for the views
* Padding: 24
* Save the form and name it “OSLO”, close the form.

####2. Create an App

Select Apps in the “User Interface” section of the navigation pane.

* Right click and new App
* Name it “OSLO”
* Select form OSLO
* Check all default views and set Main - map as default, the app will be available from all devices.
* Give the app appropriate security

####3. Deploy to all

Check the website to verify that the app is published and available.

####4. Create local object Bike Stations

*Note: Occurrences=Unbounded and Datatypes as defined in the pictures below:*

![oppg11fig6updated.jpg](media/oppg11fig6updated.jpg)

####5. Visualization in Map-control

Add a Map control (found under Reporting and Visualization)

1. Add Layer for Basemap (found under General properties)
   * Type = Map
   * Server Type = OSM
2. Add Layer for Bike Stations
   * Type = Point
   * DS = Bike Stations
   * Location fields
     - Northing = latitude
     - Easting = longitude
     - Coordinate system = WGS84
   * Select an appropriate symbol, set the size to 32px, and choose a color of your choice.

####6. Create local action "Get bikes". 
   
1. Create a local action named "Get bikes".
   The second source of data is Oslo Bysykkel. Link to API documentation: https://oslobysykkel.no/apne-data/sanntid
   * Open the Get bikes-action.
   * In the Actions-pane add Consume a REST Service-effect
   * URL: https://gbfs.urbansharing.com/oslobysykkel.no/station_information.json
   * Click the Test-button and click Send. The response of the API call is shown in Response Body. Click Handle Current Response. Open the entry in Response Handlers by double-clicking or pressing Modify. Genus has created a mapping from the test-run (this is VERY time consuming for the developer of the app, appreciate Genus :smile:).
   
   ![oppg11fig10Updated.JPG](media/oppg11fig10Updated.JPG)
   
   * Configure the response handler as the screenshot illustrates:
   
   ![oppg11fig8updated.JPG](media/oppg11fig8updated.JPG)  
   
   * When the action “Get bikes” is executed, the API is called and the return data is mapped to the specified data source, creating X number of Bike stations with its associated data.
   * To see the result of the call, create a command executing the Get bikes action and add it as a On Load Form event. Data will be populated when the form is accessed. Deploy to all and see that the map contains Bike stations.
   
   *Note: Give the action appropriate security (Properties > security).*

####7. Add Popup Content to the point layer

Define Popup Contents for the Bik Stations layers which show information (for instance id and name) on click. Customize it (try to be creative, maybe we don’t need label?)

![oppg11fig11updated.jpg](media/oppg11fig11updated.jpg)

   
####8. Display available and locked bikes

1. Create local action "Get bike availability".
   * Information about available and locked bikes will have to be added to the Bike Stations objects after their initial creation, with a separate API-call. Accordingly, you will have to create a new Local Object to store availability data temporarily. Do this by creating a local object named “availability” (unbounded, and String-fields "id", "bikes" and "locks") inside a local action "Get bike availability". See screenshots.

   ![oppg11fig12.JPG](media/oppg11fig12.JPG)
   ![oppg11fig13.JPG](media/oppg11fig13.JPG)
 
2. Add a REST service.
   * Add a Rest service to call https://gbfs.urbansharing.com/oslobysykkel.no/station_status.json. Map it to the availability DS. Then the data must be copied from availability DS to the bikes DS via a modify object-effect. See screenshot. 
   
   *Note: The filter is important to ensure correct modifications!*

   ![oppg11fig14.JPG](media/oppg11fig14.JPG)
   ![oppg11fig15.JPG](media/oppg11fig15.JPG)

3. Publish action and edit Popup Content.
   * Create a command
   * Add another On Load Form. 
   * Add bikes and locks to popup content. 
   * Deploy to all and verify that you can see name and availability of bikes on the map.

####9. OPTIONAL challenges:

1. Get weather forecasts 
   
   Get weather forecasts from YR and dispay bike stations only if it's not raining.

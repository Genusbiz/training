# Welcome to Genus Academy!

We have tailored a relevant and educational training program for new modelers, new business engineers and others who want to learn more about model driven development, low-code and Genus.

This training program provides a half-finished solution to participants. Through assignments, participants are guided the process of building a CRM system. A completed blueprint solution and competent instructors will always be at hand if you get stuck somewhere along the way. Participants can log on to the blueprint solution at any time to see how it works and how it is designed, but note that the blueprint may not have solved all tasks in the exact same way as the assignments and may have taken some creative freedoms.

The training program consists of a combination of sessions and presentations from the trainer - theme by theme - followed by task-solving. The tasks can be found here at the menu to the left. The tasks start with step-by-step descriptions of what to do and become less restricted along the way in the program. You always have the suggested solution available. Emphasis should be placed on understanding _what you do_ rather than _rushing through_. Ask your supervisor if there are concepts and tasks that seem unclear.

The suggested solution is _Genus CRM_: A Customer Relationship Management solution similar to e.g. [SuperOffice](https://www.superoffice.com/), which mainly offers sales support, customer relationship management, customer request handling, document archives, email archives & mailing etc.
The half-finished solution you start with, contains parts of the blueprint solution. Your task is to expand the solution with new objects, functionality and user interface forms.

The solution is in a "sandbox environment" and will be reset after the training program - in other words - you can play freely in your solution.

The assigned tasks assume to some extent that you refer to Genus' documentation, or that you ask your supervisor if you are stuck. Genus' documentation can be found at [docs.genus.no] (https://docs.genus.no/). The documentation may not answer all your questions, so feel free to contact your trainer as much as needed!

# User Interface in Genus Apps: Forms, Tables and Ribbon
**SESSION BY INSTRUCTOR:** *The instructor will give you a brief introduction to the creation of Forms and Tables in Genus. Notify the instructor if you have reached this point before the session.*

You have made the object Contact, but still it is not possible for the end user to see or register them. For that to happen, you must add Contacts to the user interface. Read the following information about user interface in Genus before you do the next exercise:

In Genus Desktop there are two main constrcutions which are used to show information; Forms and Tables. Both Tables and Forms can have a Ribbon. A Ribbon is a toolbar situated at the top of the window which shows functionality relevant to the context.

##Forms 
Forms are tailor-made displays that can show fields, lists, buttons, file-previews, etc., with very little limitations in terms of layout (a bunch of traditional and "bleeding edge" layout controls are available). Forms can be used to show data from one or multiple objects together in the same view. One can also switch between different views (to create "wizard"-like functionality). A Form can be customized to Desktop or Apps - the latter implies that you model a whole platform independent mobile app or website in Genus Studio.

Forms can, in their simplest form, be a display of one single object (e.g. display details about one contact), but they can also be fairly advanced and based on Use Cases, e.g. big displays for managing activities with lists, warnings, buttons, detailed information and previews in the same window.

##Table 
Tables are used to display simple lists or aggregated lists of data. One can do searches in them or apply various filters. Tables are typically placed in the Navigation Pane on the left-hand side of the client, e.g. "Customers" in Genus CRM.
Tables can also be "plugged" into Forms (e.g. list Contacts associated with a Company), but for such ad hoc purposes, Forms also have their own control (Grid) which is quicker to set up. However, if an object is going to be listed several places, a Table may be the preferred solution.

The exercises concerning user interface are not as detailed as those concerning the rest of the modeling. Hence, you are free to define much of the solution's appearance yourself.
